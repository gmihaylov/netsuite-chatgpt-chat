## Remembering of previous messages / history / preserving context 
- Since version 1.1.0 the Service Suitelet is sending back all messages from the previous conversation to the API.
- Context is preserved by current user ID
- Even if you log out from NetSuite and come back, you can ask what you asked previously.

- History of previous conversation is preserved in the Script Folder in format UserID.json. You can delete previous conversation by deleting JSON file.
